    "# Homework 10: Cleaning data with Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to use regular expressions!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hints and notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening files in subdirectories\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this notebook might be **homework/**, but!!! the csvs and text files might be in **homework/scraped/** or **/homework/scraped/minutes_pdfs** or **/homework/pdfs/**. To open a file in a subdirectory, instead of having the filename be `\"file.csv\"` you'll just use `\"some/subfolder/file.csv\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening text files\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open up a file, read it in and show you the first 500 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "contents = open(\"your-filename.txt\").read()\n",
    "contents[0:500]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> You might need `open(\"your-filename.txt\", encoding=\"utf8\").read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using regex\n",
    "\n",
    "For some dumb reason you need to put `r` in front of the string you use when you're talking about regex. Just plain `\"(\\d\\d\\d)\"` will usually work, but *sometimes* it won't and you'll need `r\"(\\d\\d\\d)`. It's best to just use the `r` all of the time, if you can remember!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `.str.extract`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `.str.extract`, you're always going to **capture one thing** and save it to a new column. You need to wrap the things you're interested in with parenthesis `(` `)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['phone_number'] = df['old_column'].str.extract(r\"My phone number is (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting pandas options\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a lot of options, like how many columns or rows it will show you, or how many characters it will show in a column before it stops showing you anything. Here are a few useful ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `display.max_cols`: Number of columns to show at once\n",
    "* `display.max_rows`: Number of rows to show at once\n",
    "* `display.max_colwidth`: Maximum number of characters displayed from a string\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set them using `pd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 1000)`, for example, to show 1000 rows at a time. You can find a lot more at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.set_option.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular expressions reference\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally think http://www.regular-expressions.info/ is a wonderful wonderful reference (and tutorial), even if it's ugly! But here's a quick reference for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\d` is a digit\n",
    "* `\\d*` is zero or more digits \n",
    "* `\\d+` is one or more digits\n",
    "* `.` matches anything for ONE character\n",
    "* `.*` is \"give me anything forever\"\n",
    "* `\\s` is whitespace, a.k.a. spaces and tabs\n",
    "* `\\w` is a word character, which includes capital and lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens.\n",
    "* You can put `*` after anything, so `\\w*` would mean \"as many word characters as you can find\"\n",
    "* `\\b` is a word boundary (you'll need the `r\"\"` thing for this one)\n",
    "* `( )` is a \"capture group\" for saving something\n",
    "* `\\1` is used when doing find/replace to say \"put the first captured group here\" (note, it's a dollar sign instead of a backslash in some editors)\n",
    "* `[ABCDE]` is a character class, which means \"match one of these, I don't care which\"\n",
    "* dollar sign means \"end of the line\"\n",
    "* caret ^ means \"beginning of the line\"\n",
    "* `\\.` means \"no really seriously I mean a period not just anything\"\n",
    "* You can use `\\` with anything else that would normally be a special character, too, not just periods. `(` or `[` or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning up extracted columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you get `\\n` (newlines) or spaces or `\\t` (tabs) or stuff at the beginning or the end of your column. `.str.strip()` will usually take care of that, just attach it after your `.str.extract()`\n",
    "\n",
    "After you extract something, it's still a string even though you look at it and know it's a number. Use `.astype(int)` to turn it into an integer (no decimal) or `.astype(float)` to turn it into a float (yes decimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing regular expressions in general\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if I'm using regex in pandas or Python, I like to test them in my text editor with \"Find.\" The highlighting really helps me see if I'm matching things! I also like to think \"what stays the same?\" when designing patterns, write those parts first, then fill in the blanks with what I want to capture."

    "# Part 1: Using `.str.extract` to pull data from columns in pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 H&M\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up `hm.csv` from the `scraped` directory. I want **four new columns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `price_original`, the original price, one of the new price\n",
    "2. `price_discounted`, the discounted price\n",
    "3. `pct_discount`, the percent discount\n",

    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Remember that `$` is a special regex symbol! You might need to escape it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** When doing `.str.extract`, the whole match doesn't get captured, only what you put `()` around! Think about anchoring to different points of the string, or things in the string.\n",

    "**Tip:** Not all prices have cents!\n",
